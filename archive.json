For example, RFC 7925 says: \"For use with this profile, the PSK identities SHOULD NOT assume a structured format (such as domain names, distinguished names, or IP addresses), and a byte-by-byte comparison operation MUST be used by the server for any operation related to the PSK identity.\"\r\n\r\n> Similarly, RFC 4279 in Section 5.1 describes the UTF-8 encoding of identities to improve interoperability for those cases where the identity is configured by a human using some management interface.\r\n\r\n> If in TLS 1.3, the identity is only used as a hint for looking up the correct PSK in the database, then this would be a significant departure from what was the norm previously. Highlighting this in our document would make sense.\r\n\r\n> The current text also says 'These callbacks must provide the PSK identity (as a character string)'. But the openssl s_server and s_client seem to work without providing PSK identities and use the default character string 'Client_identity' as the psk_identity.",

For example, RFC 7925 says: \"For use with this profile, the PSK identities SHOULD NOT assume a structured format (such as domain names, distinguished names, or IP addresses), and a byte-by-byte comparison operation MUST be used by the server for any operation related to the PSK identity.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly, RFC 4279 in Section 5.1 describes the UTF-8 encoding of identities to improve interoperability for those cases where the identity is configured by a human using some management interface. \r\n\r\nIf in TLS 1.3, the identity is only used as a hint for looking up the correct PSK in the database, then this would be a significant departure from what was the norm previously. Highlighting this in our document would make sense.\r\n\r\nThe current text also says 'These callbacks must provide the PSK identity (as a character string)'. But the openssl s_server and s_client seem to work without providing PSK identities and use the default character string 'Client_identity' as the psk_identity. ",
