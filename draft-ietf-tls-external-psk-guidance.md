# Introduction

This document provides usage guidance for external Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs) in TLS.
It lists TLS security properties provided by PSKs under certain assumptions and
demonstrates how violations of these assumptions lead to attacks. This document
also discusses PSK use cases, provisioning processes, and TLS stack implementation
support in the context of these assumptions. It provides advice for applications
in various use cases to help meet these assumptions.

The guidance provided in this document is applicable across TLS {{!RFC8446}},
DTLS {{!I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13}}, and Constrained TLS {{?I-D.ietf-tls-ctls}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Notation

For purposes of this document, a "logical node" is a computing presence that
other parties can interact with via the TLS protocol. A logical node could
potentially be realized with multiple physical instances operating under common
administrative control, e.g., a server farm. An "endpoint" is a client or server
participating in a connection.

# PSK Security Properties {#sec-properties}

The external PSK authentication mechanism in TLS implicitly assumes
one fundamental property: each PSK is known to exactly one client and
one server, and that these never switch roles. If this assumption is
violated, then the security properties of TLS are severely weakened.

As discussed in {{use-cases}}, there are use cases where it is
desirable for multiple clients or multiple servers to share a PSK. If
this is done naively by having all members share a common key, then
TLS only authenticates the entire group, and the security of the
overall system is inherently rather brittle. There are a number of
obvious weaknesses here:

1. Any group member can impersonate any other group member.
2. If a group member is compromised, then the attacker can impersonate any
group member (this follows from property (1)).
3. If PSK without DH is used, then compromise of any group member allows the
attacker to passively read all traffic.

In addition to these, a malicious non-member can reroute handshakes
between honest group members to connect them in unintended ways, as
detailed below. (Note that this class of attack is not possible if each party uses
the SNI extension and terminates the connection on mismatch {{!RFC6066}}{{Selfie}}.)

Let the group of peers who know the key be `A`, `B`, and `C`.
The attack proceeds as follows:

1. `A` sends a `ClientHello` to `B`.
2. The attacker intercepts the message and redirects it to `C`.
3. `C` responds with a `ServerHello` to `A`.
4. `A` sends a `Finished` message to `B`.
`A` has completed the handshake, ostensibly with `B`.
5. The attacker redirects the `Finished` message to `C`.
`C` has completed the handshake, ostensibly with `A`.

This attack violates the peer authentication property, and if `C` supports a
weaker set of cipher suites than `B`, this attack also violates the downgrade
protection property. This rerouting is a type of identity misbinding attack
{{Krawczyk}}{{Sethi}}. Selfie attack {{Selfie}} is a special case of the rerouting
attack against a group member that can act both as TLS server and client. In the
Selfie attack, a malicious non-member reroutes a connection from the client to
the server on the same endpoint.

Entropy properties of external PSKs may also affect TLS security properties. In
particular, if a high entropy PSK is used, then PSK-only key establishment modes
are secure against both active and passive attack. However, they lack forward
security. Forward security may be achieved by using a PSK-DH mode.

In contrast, if a low entropy PSK is used, then PSK-only key establishment modes
are subject to passive exhaustive search passive attacks which will reveal the
traffic keys. PSK-DH modes are subject to active attacks in which the attacker
impersonates one side. The exhaustive search phase of these attacks can be mounted
offline if the attacker captures a single handshake using the PSK, but those
attacks will not lead to compromise of the traffic keys for that connection because
those also depend on the Diffie-Hellman (DH) exchange. Low entropy keys are only
secure against active attack if a PAKE is used with TLS. The Crypto Forum Research
 Group (CFRG) is currently working on specifying a standard PAKE (see {{?I-D.irtf-cfrg-cpace}} and {{?I-D.krawczyk-cfrg-opaque}}).

# Privacy Properties

PSK privacy properties are orthogonal to security properties described in {{sec-properties}}.
Traditionally, TLS does little to keep PSK identity information private. For example,
an adversary learns information about the external PSK or its identifier by virtue of it
appearing in cleartext in a ClientHello. As a result, a passive adversary can link
two or more connections together that use the same external PSK on the wire. Applications should
take precautions when using external PSKs to mitigate these risks.

In addition to linkability in the network, external PSKs are intrinsically linkable by PSK receivers.
Specifically, servers can link successive connections that use the same external PSK together. Preventing
this type of linkability is out of scope, as PSKs are explicitly designed to support mutual authentication.

# External PSK Use Cases and Provisioning Processes {#use-cases}

Pre-shared Key (PSK) ciphersuites were first specified for TLS in 2005. Now, PSK is an integral
part of the TLS version 1.3 specification {{!RFC8446}}. TLS 1.3 also uses PSKs for session resumption.
It distinguishes these resumption PSKs from external PSKs which have been provisioned out-of-band (OOB).
Below, we list some example use-cases where pair-wise external PSKs with TLS have been used for
authentication.

- Device-to-device communication with out-of-band synchronized keys. PSKs provisioned out-of-band
for communicating with known identities, wherein the identity to use is discovered via a different
online protocol.

- Intra-data-center communication. Machine-to-machine communication within a single data center
or PoP may use externally provisioned PSKs, primarily for the purposes of supporting TLS
connections with fast open (0-RTT data).

- Certificateless server-to-server communication. Machine-to-machine communication
may use externally provisioned PSKs, primarily for the purposes of establishing TLS
connections without requiring the overhead of provisioning and managing PKI certificates.

- Internet of Things (IoT) and devices with limited computational capabilities. {{?RFC7925}}
defines TLS and DTLS profiles for resource-constrained devices and suggests the use of PSK
ciphersuites for compliant devices. The Open Mobile Alliance Lightweight Machine to
Machine Technical Specification {{LwM2M}} states that LwM2M servers MUST support the PSK mode of DTLS.

- Use of PSK ciphersuites are optional when securing RADIUS {{?RFC2865}} with TLS as specified
in {{?RFC6614}}.

- The Generic Authentication Architecture (GAA) defined by 3GGP mentions that TLS-PSK can be used
between a server and user equipment for authentication {{GAA}}.

- Smart Cards. The electronic German ID (eID) card supports authentication of a card holder to
online services with TLS-PSK {{SmartCard}}.

There are also use cases where PSKs are shared between more than two entities. Some examples below
(as noted by Akhmetzyanova et al.{{Akhmetzyanova}}):

- Group chats. In this use-case, the membership of a group is confirmed by the possession of a PSK
distributed out-of-band to the group participants. Members can then establish peer-to-peer connections
with each other using the external PSK. It is important to note that any node of the group can behave
as a TLS client or server.

- Internet of Things (IoT). In this use-case, resource-constrained IoT devices act as TLS clients and share the
same PSK. The devices use this PSK for quickly establishing connections with a central server. Such a scheme
ensures that the client IoT devices are legitimate members of the system. To perform rare system specific
operations that require a higher security level, the central server can request resource-intensive client
authentication with the usage of a certificate after successfully establishing the connection with a PSK.

## Provisioning Examples

- Many industrial protocols assume that PSKs are distributed and assigned manually via one of the following
approaches: typing the PSK into the devices, or via web server masks (using a Trust On First Use (TOFU)
approach with a device completely unprotected before the first login did take place). Many devices have very
limited UI. For example, they may only have a numeric keypad or even less number of buttons. When the TOFU
approach is not suitable, entering the key would require typing it on a constrained UI. Moreover, PSK production
lacks guidance unlike user passwords.

- Some devices provision PSKs via an out-of-band, cloud-based syncing protocol.

- Some secrets may be baked into or hardware or software device components. Moreover, when this is done
at manufacturing time, secrets may be printed on labels or included in a Bill of Materials for ease of
scanning or import.

## Provisioning Constraints

PSK provisioning systems are often constrained in application-specific ways. For example, although one goal of
provisioning is to ensure that each pair of nodes has a unique key pair, some systems do not want to distribute
pair-wise shared keys to achieve this. As another example, some systems require the provisioning process to embed
application-specific information in either PSKs or their identities. Identities may sometimes need to be routable,
as is currently under discussion for EAP-TLS-PSK {{?I-D.mattsson-emu-eap-tls-psk}}.

# Recommendations for External PSK Usage

Applications MUST use external PSKs that adhere to the following requirements:

1. Each PSK SHOULD be derived from at least 128 bits of entropy, MUST be at least
128 bits long, and SHOULD be combined with a DH exchange for forward secrecy. As
discussed in {{sec-properties}}, low entropy PSKs, i.e., those derived from less
than 128 bits of entropy, are subject to attack and SHOULD be avoided. If only
low-entropy keys are available, then key establishment mechanisms such as Password
Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) that mitigate the risk of offline dictionary
attacks SHOULD be employed. Note that these mechanisms do not necessarily follow
the same architecture as the ordinary process for incorporating EPSKs described
in this draft.

2. Unless other accommodations are made, each PSK MUST be restricted in
its use to at most two logical nodes: one logical node in a TLS client
role and one logical node in a TLS server role. (The two logical nodes
MAY be the same, in different roles.) Two acceptable accommodations
are described in {{!I-D.ietf-tls-external-psk-importer}}: (1) exchanging
client and server identifiers over the TLS connection after the
handshake, and (2) incorporating identifiers for both the client and the
server into the context string for an EPSK importer.

3. Nodes SHOULD use external PSK importers {{!I-D.ietf-tls-external-psk-importer}}
when configuring PSKs for a pair of TLS client and server.

4. Where possible the master PSK (that which is fed into the importer) SHOULD be
deleted after the imported keys have been generated. This protects an attacker
from bootstrapping a compromise of one node into the ability to attack connections
between any node; otherwise the attacker can recover the master key and then
re-run the importer itself.

## Stack Interfaces

Most major TLS implementations support external PSKs. Stacks supporting external PSKs
provide interfaces that applications may use when supplying them for individual connections.
Details about existing stacks at the time of writing are below.

- OpenSSL and BoringSSL: Applications specify support for external PSKs via distinct ciphersuites.
They also then configure callbacks that are invoked for PSK selection during the handshake.
These callbacks must provide a PSK identity and key. The exact format of the callback depends
on the negotiated TLS protocol version with new callback functions added specifically to OpenSSL
for TLS 1.3 {{!RFC8446}} PSK support. The PSK length is validated to be between \[1, 256\] bytes.
The PSK identity may be up to 128 bytes long.
- mbedTLS: Client applications configure PSKs before creating a connection by providing the PSK
identity and value inline. Servers must implement callbacks similar to that of OpenSSL. Both PSK
identity and key lengths may be between \[1, 16\] bytes long.
- gnuTLS: Applications configure PSK values, either as raw byte strings or
hexadecimal strings. The PSK identity and key size are not validated.
- wolfSSL: Applications configure PSKs with callbacks similar to OpenSSL.

### PSK Identity Encoding and Comparison

Section 5.1 of {{?RFC4279}} mandates that the PSK identity should be first converted
to a character string and then encoded to octets using UTF-8. This was done to avoid
interoperability problems (especially when the identity is configured by human users).
On the other hand, {{?RFC7925}} advises  implementations against assuming any
structured format for PSK identities and recommends byte-by-byte comparison for
any operation. TLS version 1.3 {{!RFC8446}} follows the same practice of specifying
the PSK identity as a sequence of opaque bytes (shown as opaque identity<1..2^16-1>
in the specification). {{!RFC8446}} also requires that the PSK identities are at
least 1 byte and at the most 65535 bytes in length. Although {{!RFC8446}} does not
place strict requirements on the format of PSK identities, we do however note that
the format of PSK identities can vary depending on the deployment:

- The PSK identity MAY be a user configured string when used in protocols like
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) {{?RFC3748}}. gnuTLS for example treats
PSK identities as usernames.
- PSK identities MAY have a domain name suffix for roaming and federation.
- Deployments should take care that the length of the PSK identity is sufficient
to avoid obvious collisions.

### PSK Identity Collisions

It is possible, though unlikely, that an external PSK identity may clash with a
resumption PSK identity. The TLS stack implementation and sequencing of PSK callbacks
influences the application's behaviour when identity collisions occur. When a server
receives a PSK identity in a TLS 1.3 ClientHello, some TLS stacks
execute the application's registered callback function before checking the stack's
internal session resumption cache. This means that if a PSK identity collision occurs,
the application will be given precedence over how to handle the PSK.

# Security Considerations {#security-con}

It is NOT RECOMMENDED to share the same PSK between more than one client and server.
However, as discussed in {{use-cases}}, there are application scenarios that may
rely on sharing the same PSK among multiple nodes. {{!I-D.ietf-tls-external-psk-importer}}
helps in mitigating rerouting and Selfie style reflection attacks when the PSK
is shared among multiple nodes. This is achieved by correctly using the node
identifiers in the ImportedIdentity.context construct specified in
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-external-psk-importer}}. It is RECOMMENDED that each endpoint
selects one globally unique identifier and uses it in all PSK handshakes. The
unique identifier can, for example, be one of its MAC addresses, a 32-byte
random number, or its Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) {{?RFC4122}}. Each
endpoint SHOULD know the identifier of the other endpoint with which its wants
to connect and SHOULD compare it with the other endpoint’s identifier used in
ImportedIdentity.context. It is however important to remember that endpoints
sharing the same group PSK can always impersonate each other.
