# Introduction

This document provides guidance on the use of external Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs)
in Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 {{RFC8446}}. This guidance also
applies to Datagram TLS (DTLS) 1.3 {{I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13}} and
Compact TLS 1.3 {{I-D.ietf-tls-ctls}}. For readability, this document uses
the term TLS to refer to all such versions.

External PSKs are symmetric
secret keys provided to the TLS protocol implementation as external inputs.
External PSKs are provisioned out-of-band.

This document lists
TLS security properties provided by PSKs under certain assumptions and
demonstrates how violations of these assumptions lead to attacks. This
document discusses PSK use cases, provisioning processes, and TLS stack
implementation support in the context of these assumptions. This document
also provides advice for applications in various use cases to help meet
these assumptions.

There are many resources that provide guidance for password generation and
verification aimed towards improving security. However, there is no such
equivalent for external Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs) in TLS. This document aims
to reduce that gap.

# Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP&nbsp;14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Notation

For purposes of this document, a "logical node" is a computing presence that
other parties can interact with via the TLS protocol. A logical node could
potentially be realized with multiple physical instances operating under common
administrative control, e.g., a server farm. An "endpoint" is a client or server
participating in a connection.

# PSK Security Properties {#sec-properties}

The use of a previously established PSK allows TLS nodes to authenticate
the endpoint identities. It also offers other benefits, including
resistance to attacks in presence of quantum computers;
see {{entropy}} for related discussion. However, these keys do not provide
privacy protection of endpoint identities, nor do they provide non-repudiation
(one endpoint in a connection can deny the conversation); see {{endpoint-privacy}}
for related discussion.

PSK authentication security implicitly assumes one fundamental property: each
PSK is known to exactly one client and one server, and that these never switch
roles. If this assumption is violated, then the security properties of TLS are
severely weakened as discussed below.

## Shared PSKs

As discussed in {{use-cases}}, to demonstrate their attack, {{AASS19}} describes
scenarios where multiple clients or multiple servers share a PSK. If
this is done naively by having all members share a common key, then
TLS authenticates only group membership, and the security of the
overall system is inherently rather brittle. There are a number of
obvious weaknesses here:

1. Any group member can impersonate any other group member.
1. If PSK is combined with a fresh ephemeral key exchange, then compromise of a group member that knows
the resulting shared secret will enable the attacker to passively read (and actively modify) traffic.
1. If PSK is not combined with fresh ephemeral key exchange, then compromise of any group member allows the
attacker to passively read (and actively modify) all traffic, including reading past traffic.

Additionally, a malicious non-member can reroute handshakes between honest group members
to connect them in unintended ways, as described below. Note that a partial mitigation
against this class of attack is available: each group member includes the SNI extension {{RFC6066}}
and terminates the connection on mismatch between the presented SNI value and the
receiving member's known identity. See {{Selfie}} for details.

To illustrate the rerouting attack, consider three peers, `A`, `B`, and `C`,
who all know the PSK. The attack proceeds as follows:

1. `A` sends a `ClientHello` to `B`.
1. The attacker intercepts the message and redirects it to `C`.
1. `C` responds with a second flight (`ServerHello`, ...) to `A`.
1. `A` sends a `Finished` message to `B`.
`A` has completed the handshake, ostensibly with `B`.
1. The attacker redirects the `Finished` message to `C`.
`C` has completed the handshake with `A`.

In this attack, peer authentication is not provided. Also, if `C` supports a
weaker set of cipher suites than `B`, cryptographic algorithm downgrade attacks
might be possible. This rerouting is a type of identity misbinding attack
{{Krawczyk}}{{Sethi}}. Selfie attack {{Selfie}} is a special case of the rerouting
attack against a group member that can act both as TLS server and client. In the
Selfie attack, a malicious non-member reroutes a connection from the client to
the server on the same endpoint.

Finally, in addition to these weaknesses, sharing a PSK across nodes may negatively
affect deployments. For example, revocation of individual group members is not
possible without establishing a new PSK for all of the non-revoked members.

## PSK Entropy {#entropy}

Entropy properties of external PSKs may also affect TLS security properties. For example,
if a high entropy PSK is used, then PSK-only key establishment modes provide expected
security properties for TLS, including establishing the same
session keys between peers, secrecy of session keys, peer authentication, and downgrade
protection. See {{RFC8446, Section E.1}} for an explanation of these properties.
However, these modes lack forward security. Forward security may be achieved by using a
PSK-DH mode, or, alternatively, by using PSKs with short lifetimes.

In contrast, if a low entropy PSK is used, then PSK-only key establishment modes
are subject to passive exhaustive search attacks which will reveal the
traffic keys. PSK-DH modes are subject to active attacks in which the attacker
impersonates one side. The exhaustive search phase of these attacks can be mounted
offline if the attacker captures a single handshake using the PSK, but those
attacks will not lead to compromise of the traffic keys for that connection because
those also depend on the Diffie-Hellman (DH) exchange. Low entropy keys are only
secure against active attack if a password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) is used
with TLS. The Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) is currently working on specifying
recommended PAKEs (see {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-cpace}} and {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-opaque}}, for
the symmetric and asymmetric cases, respectively).

# External PSKs in Practice

PSK ciphersuites were first specified for TLS in 2005. PSKs are now an integral
part of the TLS version 1.3 specification {{RFC8446}}. TLS 1.3 also uses PSKs for session resumption.
It distinguishes these resumption PSKs from external PSKs which have been provisioned out-of-band.
This section describes known use cases and provisioning processes for external PSKs with TLS.

## Use Cases

This section lists some example use-cases where pair-wise external PSKs, i.e., external
PSKs that are shared between only one server and one client, have been used for authentication
in TLS.  There was no attempt to prioritize the examples in any particular order.

- Device-to-device communication with out-of-band synchronized keys. PSKs provisioned out-of-band
for communicating with known identities, wherein the identity to use is discovered via a different
online protocol.

- Intra-data-center communication. Machine-to-machine communication within a single data center
or point-of-presence (PoP) may use externally provisioned PSKs, primarily for the purposes of supporting TLS
connections with early data; see {{security-con}} for considerations when using early data
with external PSKs.

- Certificateless server-to-server communication. Machine-to-machine communication
may use externally provisioned PSKs, primarily for the purposes of establishing TLS
connections without requiring the overhead of provisioning and managing PKI certificates.

- Internet of Things (IoT) and devices with limited computational capabilities.
{{RFC7925}} defines TLS and DTLS profiles for resource-constrained devices and suggests
the use of PSK ciphersuites for compliant devices. The Open Mobile Alliance Lightweight Machine
to Machine Technical Specification {{LwM2M}} states that LwM2M servers MUST support the
PSK mode of DTLS.

- Securing RADIUS {{RFC2865}} with TLS. PSK ciphersuites are optional for this use case, as specified
in {{RFC6614}}.

- 3GPP server to user equipment authentication. The Generic Authentication Architecture (GAA) defined by
3GGP mentions that TLS-PSK ciphersuites can be used between server and user equipment for authentication {{GAA}}.

- Smart Cards. The electronic German ID (eID) card supports authentication of a card holder to
online services with TLS-PSK {{SmartCard}}.

- Quantum resistance. Some deployments may use PSKs (or combine them with certificate-based
authentication as described in {{RFC8773}}) because of the protection they provide against
quantum computers.

There are also use cases where PSKs are shared between more than two entities. Some examples below
(as noted by Akhmetzyanova et al. {{AASS19}}):

- Group chats. In this use-case, group participants may be provisioned an external PSK out-of-band for establishing
authenticated connections with other members of the group.

- Internet of Things (IoT) and devices with limited computational capabilities. Many PSK provisioning examples are
possible in this use-case. For example, in a given setting, IoT devices may all share the same PSK and use it to
communicate with a central server (one key for n devices), have their own key for communicating with a central server (n
keys for n devices), or have pairwise keys for communicating with each other (n^2 keys for n devices).

## Provisioning Examples

The exact provisioning process depends on the system requirements and threat
model. Whenever possible, avoid sharing a PSK between nodes; however, sharing
a PSK among several nodes is sometimes unavoidable. When PSK sharing happens,
other accommodations SHOULD be used as discussed in {{recommendations}}.

Examples of PSK provisioning processes are included below.

- Many industrial protocols assume that PSKs are distributed and assigned manually via one of the following
approaches: typing the PSK into the devices, or using a Trust On First Use (TOFU) approach with a device
completely unprotected before the first login did take place. Many devices have very limited UI. For example,
they may only have a numeric keypad or even fewer buttons. When the TOFU approach is not suitable,
entering the key would require typing it on a constrained UI.

- Some devices provision PSKs via an out-of-band, cloud-based syncing protocol.

- Some secrets may be baked into hardware or software device components. Moreover, when this is done
at manufacturing time, secrets may be printed on labels or included in a Bill of Materials for ease of
scanning or import.

## Provisioning Constraints

PSK provisioning systems are often constrained in application-specific ways. For example, although one goal of
provisioning is to ensure that each pair of nodes has a unique key pair, some systems do not want to distribute
pair-wise shared keys to achieve this. As another example, some systems require the provisioning process to embed
application-specific information in either PSKs or their identities. Identities may sometimes need to be routable,
as is currently under discussion for EAP-TLS-PSK {{I-D.mattsson-emu-eap-tls-psk}}.

# Recommendations for External PSK Usage {#recommendations}

Recommended requirements for applications using external PSKs are as follows:

1. Each PSK SHOULD be derived from at least 128 bits of entropy, MUST be at least
128 bits long, and SHOULD be combined with an ephemeral key exchange, e.g., by using the
"psk_dhe_ke" Pre-Shared Key Exchange Mode in TLS 1.3, for forward secrecy. As
discussed in {{sec-properties}}, low entropy PSKs, i.e., those derived from less
than 128 bits of entropy, are subject to attack and SHOULD be avoided. If only
low-entropy keys are available, then key establishment mechanisms such as Password
Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) that mitigate the risk of offline dictionary attacks
SHOULD be employed. Note that no such mechanisms have yet been standardised, and further
that these mechanisms will not necessarily follow the same architecture as the
process for incorporating external PSKs described in {{I-D.ietf-tls-external-psk-importer}}.

2. Unless other accommodations are made to mitigate the risks of PSKs known to a group, each PSK MUST be restricted in
its use to at most two logical nodes: one logical node in a TLS client
role and one logical node in a TLS server role. (The two logical nodes
MAY be the same, in different roles.) Two acceptable accommodations
are described in {{I-D.ietf-tls-external-psk-importer}}: (1) exchanging
client and server identifiers over the TLS connection after the
handshake, and (2) incorporating identifiers for both the client and the
server into the context string for an external PSK importer.

3. Nodes SHOULD use external PSK importers {{I-D.ietf-tls-external-psk-importer}}
when configuring PSKs for a client-server pair when applicable. Importers make provisioning
external PSKs easier and less error prone by deriving a unique, imported PSK from the
external PSK for each key derivation function a node supports. See the Security Considerations
in {{I-D.ietf-tls-external-psk-importer}} for more information.

4. Where possible the main PSK (that which is fed into the importer) SHOULD be
deleted after the imported keys have been generated. This prevents an attacker
from bootstrapping a compromise of one node into the ability to attack connections
between any node; otherwise the attacker can recover the main key and then
re-run the importer itself.

## Stack Interfaces

Most major TLS implementations support external PSKs. Stacks supporting external PSKs
provide interfaces that applications may use when configuring PSKs for individual
connections. Details about some existing stacks at the time of writing are below.

- OpenSSL and BoringSSL: Applications can specify support for external PSKs via
distinct ciphersuites in TLS 1.2 and below. They also then configure callbacks that are invoked for
PSK selection during the handshake. These callbacks must provide a PSK identity and key. The
exact format of the callback depends on the negotiated TLS protocol version, with new callback
functions added specifically to OpenSSL for TLS 1.3 {{RFC8446}} PSK support. The PSK length
is validated to be between \[1, 256\] bytes. The PSK identity may be up to 128 bytes long.
- mbedTLS: Client applications configure PSKs before creating a connection by providing the PSK
identity and value inline. Servers must implement callbacks similar to that of OpenSSL. Both PSK
identity and key lengths may be between \[1, 16\] bytes long.
- gnuTLS: Applications configure PSK values, either as raw byte strings or
hexadecimal strings. The PSK identity and key size are not validated.
- wolfSSL: Applications configure PSKs with callbacks similar to OpenSSL.

### PSK Identity Encoding and Comparison

Section 5.1 of {{?RFC4279}} mandates that the PSK identity should be first converted to a character string and then
encoded to octets using UTF-8. This was done to avoid interoperability problems (especially when the identity is
configured by human users).  On the other hand, {{RFC7925}} advises  implementations against assuming any structured
format for PSK identities and recommends byte-by-byte comparison for any operation. When PSK identities are configured
manually it is important to be aware that due to encoding issues visually identical strings may, in fact, differ.

TLS version 1.3 {{RFC8446}} follows the same practice of specifying
the PSK identity as a sequence of opaque bytes (shown as opaque identity<1..2^16-1>
in the specification) that thus is compared on a byte-by-byte basis.
{{RFC8446}} also requires that the PSK identities are at
least 1 byte and at the most 65535 bytes in length. Although {{RFC8446}} does not
place strict requirements on the format of PSK identities, we do however note that
the format of PSK identities can vary depending on the deployment:

- The PSK identity MAY be a user configured string when used in protocols like
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) {{?RFC3748}}. gnuTLS for example treats
PSK identities as usernames.
- PSK identities MAY have a domain name suffix for roaming and federation. In
applications and settings where the domain name suffix is privacy sensitive, this
practice is NOT RECOMMENDED.
- Deployments should take care that the length of the PSK identity is sufficient
to avoid collisions.

### PSK Identity Collisions

It is possible, though unlikely, that an external PSK identity may clash with a
resumption PSK identity. The TLS stack implementation and sequencing of PSK callbacks
influences the application's behavior when identity collisions occur. When a server
receives a PSK identity in a TLS 1.3 ClientHello, some TLS stacks
execute the application's registered callback function before checking the stack's
internal session resumption cache. This means that if a PSK identity collision occurs,
the application's external PSK usage will typically take precedence over the internal
session resumption path.

Since resumption PSK identities are assigned by the TLS stack implementation,
it is RECOMMENDED that these identifiers be assigned in a manner that lets
resumption PSKs be distinguished from external PSKs to avoid concerns with
collisions altogether.

# Privacy Considerations {#endpoint-privacy}

PSK privacy properties are orthogonal to security properties described in {{sec-properties}}.
TLS does little to keep PSK identity information private. For example,
an adversary learns information about the external PSK or its identifier by virtue of the identifier
appearing in cleartext in a ClientHello. As a result, a passive adversary can link two or
more connections together that use the same external PSK on the wire. Depending on the PSK
identity, a passive attacker may also be able to identify the device, person, or enterprise
running the TLS client or TLS server. An active attacker can also use the PSK identity to
suppress handshakes or application data from a specific device by blocking, delaying, or
rate-limiting traffic. Techniques for mitigating these risks require further analysis and are out
of scope for this document.

In addition to linkability in the network, external PSKs are intrinsically linkable
by PSK receivers. Specifically, servers can link successive connections that use the
same external PSK together. Preventing this type of linkability is out of scope.

# Security Considerations {#security-con}

Security considerations are provided throughout this document.  It bears
repeating that there are concerns related to the use of external PSKs regarding
proper identification of TLS 1.3 endpoints and additional risks when external
PSKs are known to a group.

It is NOT RECOMMENDED to share the same PSK between more than one client and server.
However, as discussed in {{use-cases}}, there are application scenarios that may
rely on sharing the same PSK among multiple nodes. {{I-D.ietf-tls-external-psk-importer}}
helps in mitigating rerouting and Selfie style reflection attacks when the PSK
is shared among multiple nodes. This is achieved by correctly using the node
identifiers in the ImportedIdentity.context construct specified in
{{I-D.ietf-tls-external-psk-importer}}. One solution would be for each endpoint
to select one globally unique identifier and use it in all PSK handshakes. The
unique identifier can, for example, be one of its MAC addresses, a 32-byte
random number, or its Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) {{RFC4122}}.
Note that such persistent, global identifiers have privacy implications;
see {{endpoint-privacy}}.

Each endpoint SHOULD know the identifier of the other endpoint with which it wants
to connect and SHOULD compare it with the other endpoint’s identifier used in
ImportedIdentity.context. It is however important to remember that endpoints
sharing the same group PSK can always impersonate each other.

Considerations for external PSK usage extend beyond proper identification.
When early data is used with an external PSK, the random value in the ClientHello
is the only source of entropy that contributes to key diversity between sessions.
As a result, when an external PSK is used more than one time, the random number
source on the client has a significant role in the protection of the early data.
